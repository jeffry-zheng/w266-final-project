# Wine Recommendation Neural Nets

In an effort to examine natural language processing approaches to classifying descriptive data, we present classic machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression) as well as deep learning algorithms (Neural Network and BERT) for identifying wine variety based on wine reviews. Using these various techniques, we compare various metrics for each model through a classification report. We find that our BERT model outperformed the two other models with a test accuracy of 78%. A further discussion into our error analysis reveals the top wines varieties that are misclassified and the potential sources of error.
